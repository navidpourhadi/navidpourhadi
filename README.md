# 👋 Navid Pourhadi: I Make Computers Think (and Sometimes Guess)

### 🤖 AI / ML Engineer & Researcher | Deep Learning Systems & Software Engineering

[cite_start]I'm an **AI/ML Engineer and Researcher** with a background in **Software Development**[cite: 3, 27]. [cite_start]I blend academic rigor from my M.Sc. in AI & Robotics at Università degli studi di Padova [cite: 41] [cite_start]with hands-on experience building full-stack platforms and production-ready AI models[cite: 29]. [cite_start]My work spans from enhancing atmospheric forecasting with **Sequence models** [cite: 25] [cite_start]to deploying **Computer Vision** systems with CNNs and GANs[cite: 33]. [cite_start]I love taking a project from research to a working product using tools like **PyTorch, Docker, and FastAPI**[cite: 19, 21].

### ✨ Fun Fact
> I build models that model time, but I still struggle to wake up on time 😅

Let’s connect and build something awesome 🚀
